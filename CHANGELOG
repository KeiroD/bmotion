2003/01/12
v0.0.5
* optimised events.tcl a bit to be more efficient
* switched the way bMotion represents its version to make it more consistent for
  proper releases etc
* adjusted the light plugin
* moved question handler to plugin
* moved pinches to a plugin
* moved asl trigger to a plugin
* tidied up code a bit
- no longer tracking chanmood, because it was rubbish
* smileys now handled by a plugin (new regexps included)
* New routine to clean []s in nicks, should be more reliable
+ Clean nicks for all entry points, not just event_main
* bMotion won't greet someone if nothing else has been said since it greeted 
  last
+ bMotion looks for modules/settings_<botnet-nick>.tcl too (and loads it after
  settings.tcl). You can use this to prevent overwriting your bot's settings
  when installing a new version of the code, and also to run more than one
  bot off the same installation of bMotion.
  For this to work, you MUST define the botnet-nick setting in your eggdrop's
  config file. Remember that it will be case sensitive, so if I have my botnet
  nick set to "NoTopic" the file has to be settings_NoTopic.tcl
+ same as above for abstracts.tcl (if you want to augment an existing one,
  use lappend not set (man lappend for more info)   


2003/01/03
v0.0.4

* bMotion should only respond once when someone changes their nick AND
  does a public away
* Fixed a potential error with bMotionLastEvent checking
+ bMotion now supports nick-change plugins
* Moved away-nickchange detection to plugins from legacy code
* Fixed a problem with plugins not loading on some systems
+ bMotion now drops output if it's identical to the trigger text that generated it

2002/12/12
v0.0.3

+ bMotion filters out metacharacters from nicks by replacing with their handle
  (if the user doesn't have a user record, it just removes the characters)
+ Put the flood checking code back in after cvs, er, ate it some time ago
* %NUMBER{} works again
- Removed some of the putlogs bMotion did during startup, because
   a) they were spelled wrong
   b) they weren't needed

2002/11/28
v0.0.2

* Fixed a couple of show-stoppers

2002/11/26
