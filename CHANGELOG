bMotion CHANGELOG
-----------------

2002/12/12
v0.0.3

+ bMotion filters out metacharacters from nicks by replacing with their handle
  (if the user doesn't have a user record, it just removes the characters)
+ Put the flood checking code back in after cvs, er, ate it some time ago
* %NUMBER{} works again
- Removed some of the putlogs bMotion did during startup, because
   a) they were spelled wrong
   b) they weren't needed

2002/11/28
v0.0.2

* Fixed a couple of show-stoppers

2002/11/26
v0.0.1

Initial release on SourceForge.net -- bMotion goes officially public for the first time o_O

Pre 2002/11/26: See CHANGELOG.old; bMotion was private for about two years.
