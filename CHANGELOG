bMotion CHANGELOG
-----------------

2003/01/03
v0.0.4

* bMotion should only respond once when someone changes their nick AND
  does a public away
* Fixed a potential error with bMotionLastEvent checking
+ bMotion now supports nick-change plugins
* Moved away-nickchange detection to plugins from legacy code
* Fixed a problem with plugins not loading on some systems
+ bMotion now drops output if it's identical to the trigger text that generated it

2002/12/12
v0.0.3

+ bMotion filters out metacharacters from nicks by replacing with their handle
  (if the user doesn't have a user record, it just removes the characters)
+ Put the flood checking code back in after cvs, er, ate it some time ago
* %NUMBER{} works again
- Removed some of the putlogs bMotion did during startup, because
   a) they were spelled wrong
   b) they weren't needed

2002/11/28
v0.0.2

* Fixed a couple of show-stoppers

2002/11/26
v0.0.1
