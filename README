README for bMotion
------------------

`Hey Keiro!  My name is DivineLightning and I am running eggdrop v1.8.0+infiniteinfo, on Linux 3.13.0-76-generic.`

This is the output one would receive when `telnet`ing to the bot.

Currently, there are a few functions that're enabled on the bot in addition to the bMotion code.

Notably, `!sysinfo` which outputs a limited set of system information on the server that `DivineLightning` is running on.

You may submit fixes via `Pull Requests` here.

Thanks for trying out bMotion!

You can also get limited assistance from #bmotion on EFNet -- note
I do this in my spare time so if I'm not around to help, don't take
it personally :) Perhaps a community of other people who can help
will spring up.

The official home for documentation is now

Have fun!
